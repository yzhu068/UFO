## Background
Dana is enthusiastic about aliens and UFO. She decided to create a website which allows people to search for reported event of UFO.

Dana uses Javascript and HTML created a dymanic table which allows users to search for events of UFO according to certain criteria. 

## Results
The updated the website allows user to search events using multiple criteria, to be specific: city, state, country and shape. 

The return results will be events that contains all the results matches the user-input results. 

(as my app.js donsen't work properly, I think it is becuase the code in step 9 is not working)

## Conclusion
1. I think the webpage can be improvded to be more user friendly. First of all, the user needs to know what criteria is proper to put. for example, the default value for "shape" is "circle", but what is the user wants to serach for other shape and she/he does not know what key word will work? for example some entries has "light" in the "shape" attribute. People who is not familiar with the data base will not know to input "light" as it is not commonly a adj. to describe shape. Also, what is the user input "United States" instead of "us"? the results will not return, although there are many events do happen in United States. 
The webpage can be improved to all user return results by "loose match" of the criteria they input. Or the webpage can list the criteria the users are allowed to use and will return results. 

2. the webpage returns all the events that matches the any criteria input. I.e. it does not have to match all the criteria. The webpage should include a function that allows user to serch for events match all the criterias she/he wants to search. For example, Dana wants to search for events happened in US and shape is "light", events should return but only events meets both criterias.
